        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>Unfortunatly it's not on my own domain, Github is serving it for you. That means you have to visit the wonky URL you can see in your search bar. It's okay though! You can at least visit my site without downloading it and you can even look at the code directly if you visit my Github repostitory. You can even suggest bug fixes! This is actually the third page I ever created for the site. the first is <a href="tests/im-test.html">an image test</a> and the second is <a href="tests/html-testing-page.html">a test of my general html skills</a>. The second one also acts as a reference. I also created the rules for a Rule Club! Check them out <a href="literature/rule-club.html">here</a>. And lastly, I have three games <a href="games/mimic-octopus.html">here</a>, <a href="games/mimic-octopus-with-seed.html">here</a>, and <a href="games/mouse-challenge.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I don't have much on the website as of now, but I will be adding more soon and I hope you like it! And remember that ymy site isn't www.issite.com, it's issite.github.com.</p>
        <p>To see an index of all pages on this site, click <a href="reference.html">here</a>.</p>
